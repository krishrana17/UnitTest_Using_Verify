This repo contains the sample unit test application which I have created to play with Verify. Verify is a snapshot tool that simplyfy the assertion in unit testing. During the assetion phase, Verify will capture a JSON representation of the result and store it into a snapshot file. Then you will see the result and you said, Ok.. this result looks good..let's go with this result. Then every time when you re-run that tests, the output of the test is compared to that original snapshot file.
If everything is the same, then test will pass. If not, the test will fails.
